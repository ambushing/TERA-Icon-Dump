# TERA Icon Dump

A `.PNG` converted dump of TERA's Icons. May not be up to date. Please check the description (should be to the right on PC) to see what version this is for. I play on the Gameforge release, and I may not update this unless I feel a reason to do so. If you can't find an icon, you can ask me (`@Ambush#0001`) to dump it again. Might take a bit though even after asking.


## FAQ
Q. **Why did you upload this?**

A. Because not everyone is technically capable, or wants to use [Terahelper](https://github.com/GoneUp/GPK_RePack) to dump the icons. Some people also don't want to deal with converting them all to a more workable format (`.PNG`). I couldn't find a dump online, and I felt it would be really nice to have one because I genuinely don't like having to do the dirty work. Lots of people use the icons for a huge variety of things, so why not just dump it?

Q. **What if I want the original format?**

A. Download Terahelper linked above and dump it yourself. It's incredibly simple.
##

Q. **Am I allowed to use these icons?**

A. Hell if I know. I'm not the copyright holder, nor am I liable for any damages that occur if you use these icons. Insert more legal jargon here.
