# TERA Icon Dump
**May not be up to date, always refer to the version on the repository description.**

This repository contains a dump of TERA's icons in a `.PNG` format. A `.PNG` converted dump of TERA's Icons. You can get icon dumps from v107+ from the releases tab in a `.ZIP` archive. You can alternatively just download the repository's code from the top right on Desktop (code -> download zip) for the current dump.


## FAQ
Q. **Will this continue being updated?**

A. I quit TERA so there's a good chance this will no longer be updated as the icon dump requires the icon `.GPK` files from the client. I'll leave the repository up for anyone who finds a use for outdated files, or gets use out of the readme to figure out how to dump them for a more recent version.
##

Q. **Why did you upload this?**

A. I needed the files in a `.PNG` format, and I was pretty annoyed that I had to convert them from their default `.DDS` file format to the `.PNG` file format. I figured that I'd save people from having to do the work themselves and upload the `.PNG` converted files to github.
##

Q. **What if I want the original .DDS format?**

A. You'll need to dump it yourself using [Terahelper](https://github.com/GoneUp/GPK_RePack) as I listed above.
##

Q. **Am I allowed to use these icons?**

A. Hell if I know. I'm not the copyright holder, nor am I liable for any damages that occur if you use these icons. Insert more legal jargon here.
